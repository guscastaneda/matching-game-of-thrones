# Matching Game of Thrones

Matching Game of Thrones is a memory card game inspired by HBO's original series Game of Thrones.

This was one of my projects for General Assembly's Front-End Development class. I wanted to merge my design and front-end development skills and have fun along the way.

I used awesome character illustrations by Nigel Evan Dennis. Make sure to check his work on twitter: @wildlingsgone / @nigelevandennis

This project is under current development. Your feedback will be very appreciated.
